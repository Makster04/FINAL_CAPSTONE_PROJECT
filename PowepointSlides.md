Absolutely — here’s a more fleshed-out, Capstone-ready version of your slides with expanded explanations and more formal tone, while keeping it engaging and story-driven:

---

## **Slide 1: Economic Regime Forecasting with ARMIS**
**Subtitle**: Classifying the Future of the Economy — One Quarter at a Time

> ARMIS is a machine learning framework designed to identify and forecast macroeconomic regime shifts in a discrete, interpretable manner. By replacing probabilistic risk scores with intuitive regime labels, ARMIS helps decision-makers act with clarity and confidence.

---

## **Slide 2: Why This Model Matters**
- Translates noisy economic signals into **clear, actionable regimes**
- Offers a structured alternative to continuous probability models.
- Doesnt offer binary results (Recession or Not), but multiple
- Enables businesses and policymakers to **prepare for transitions**, not just assess risk
- Incorporates **SHAP-based interpretability** to ensure transparency and trust

> Instead of asking, “How risky is the future?”, we ask, “What kind of economic world are we entering?”

---

## **Slide 3: The Key Conceptual Shift**
| From                                 | To                                           |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Continuous risk score (0–1)          | Discrete macroeconomic regimes               |
| “How risky is next quarter?”         | “Boom, Stability, Slowdown, or Recession?”  |
| Regression outputs                   | Multi-class classification                  |
| SHAP over a single score             | SHAP over predicted regime class distribution |
| Risk tiers (Low, Medium, High)       | Regime categories (B/S/S/R)                 |

> This reframing aligns more naturally with how stakeholders make strategic plans — in scenarios, not decimals.

---

## **Slide 4: The Core Question**
> **"Based on recent macro trends, which economic regime will the U.S. enter next?"**

**Objective**: Predict the most likely economic regime for the upcoming quarter:
- 🟢 **Boom**: Expansive growth, strong employment
- ⚖️ **Stability**: Balanced, steady macro indicators
- 🟡 **Slowdown**: Softening momentum
- 🔴 **Recession**: Negative growth, rising slack

> One prediction, updated quarterly — providing foresight, not hindsight.

---

## **Slide 5: Why It’s Marketable**
- ✅ **Human-readable output**: Easy-to-understand regime labels
- 🔍 **Transparent explanations** via SHAP for every forecast
- 🕓 **Minimal lag**: Only four quarters of history required
- 🧪 **Scenario simulation**: How regimes respond to shocks

> ARMIS bridges the gap between econometric insight and real-world application.

---

| **Stability** | Balanced signals, moderate growth, policy alignment         |
| **Slowdown** | Sluggish data, weakening demand, early signs of contraction |
| **Recession** | Declining GDP, labor market slack, disinflation            |

> Regimes are defined using **economic logic**, not NBER dates, and are assigned based on GDP growth, unemployment, and capacity utilization.
