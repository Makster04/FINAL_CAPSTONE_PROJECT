### 🟩 **SLIDE 1: Title Slide**
**Title:**  
**ARMIS: Automated Regime Modeling via Interpretable Signals**  
**Subtitle:**  
*Forecasting Next-Quarter Economic Regimes from Lagged Macroeconomic Indicators*

**Content:**  
- Your name  
- Date  
- Affiliation/logo (e.g. bootcamp, university, organization)

---

### 🟩 **SLIDE 2: Problem & Motivation**  
**Title:**  
Why Regime Classification > Binary Recession Forecasts

**Content:**  
- Most forecasts use “Recession vs Not” → too coarse  
- ARMIS provides **four clear, interpretable regimes**  
- Better for strategy, planning, and market timing  

**Visual Idea:**  
Show a funnel or quadrant chart:  
“Binary” → “Boom | Stability | Slowdown | Recession”

---

### 🟩 **SLIDE 3: Objective**  
**Title:**  
Project Goal

**Content:**  
> Predict the next quarter’s **economic regime** — one of:  
> **Boom, Stability, Slowdown, or Recession**  
> — using macroeconomic indicators from the past 4 quarters.

**Visual Idea:**  
A timeline or sliding window diagram with  
“Q-4 to Q-1 → predict Q0”

**Title:**  
Who Can Use ARMIS?

**Content (icons or avatars):**  
- 🎯 Portfolio Managers → Allocation

### 🟩 **SLIDE 5: Input Data**  
**Title:**  
Macroeconomic Indicators Used

**Content:**  
- 25+ features across Confidence, Labor, Inflation, Credit, etc.  
- Lagged by 1–4 quarters  
- Standardized, rolled, and derived

**Visual Idea:**  
Data heatmap or indicator categories (grouped by theme)  
Could show 5–6 indicators with trends across regimes.

### 🟩 **SLIDE 6: Regime Labeling Logic**  
**Title:**  
How Regimes Are Defined

**Table:**  

| Regime     | GDP | Unemployment | Capacity Utilization |
|------------|-----|--------------|-----------------------|
| Boom       | >3% | Low/falling  | High                  |
| Stability  | 1–3%| Stable       | Steady                |
| Slowdown   | <1% | Softening    | Lowering              |
| Recession  | <0% | Rising       | Falling               |

**Visual Idea:**  
Quadrant chart or regime spectrum

---

### 🟩 **SLIDE 7: Feature Engineering**  
**Title:**  
Signals Extracted

**Columns:**  
- Raw indicators  
- Derived features:  
  - Fiscal Stress = Deficit × Rate  
  - Jobs Momentum = ΔJobs / ΔUnemployment  
  - Inflation Gap = PPI – CPI  
  - Inventory Ratio = Inventories ÷ Sales  
  - Volatility Shock = ΔVIX

**Visual Idea:**  
Maybe one worked example showing how a raw indicator becomes a useful signal.

---

### 🟩 **SLIDE 8: Modeling Pipeline**  
**Title:**  
From Data to Regime Prediction

**Steps (Flowchart or icons):**  
1. Lag macro features  
2. Normalize + derive features  
3. Label historical regimes  
4. Train classifier  
5. Predict next-quarter regime  
6. Explain predictions (SHAP)

---

### 🟩 **SLIDE 9: Modeling Approaches**  
**Title:**  
Models Tested

**Table:**

| Model                    | Why Use It                        |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Logistic Regression      | Simple + interpretable baseline  |
| XGBoostClassifier        | Accuracy + SHAP-ready            |
| Random Forest            | Nonlinear + robust               |
| LSTM (optional)          | Sequence-aware (experimental)    |

---

### 🟩 **SLIDE 10: Sample Forecast Output**  
**Title:**  
Example: ARMIS Forecasts for 2024

**Table:**

| Quarter | Predicted Regime | Probabilities |
|---------|------------------|---------------|
| Q1      | Stability         | [S: 64%, SL: 24%, R: 7%, B: 5%] |
| Q2      | Slowdown          | [SL: 45%, S: 35%, R: 18%, B: 2%] |
| Q3      | Recession         | [R: 62%, SL: 28%, S: 10%, B: 0%] |

**Visual Idea:**  
Bar chart or colored timeline by quarter

---

### 🟩 **SLIDE 11: SHAP Explainability**  
**Title:**  
What Drives Each Regime?

**Content:**  
- Global SHAP → top features for each class  
- Local SHAP → what drove Q3 Recession forecast  
- SHAP Timeline → how drivers evolved

**Visual Idea:**  
Bar chart of SHAP values or SHAP waterfall for one prediction

---

### 🟩 **SLIDE 12: Evaluation Strategy**  
**Title:**
