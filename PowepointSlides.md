## 🧠 Slide 3: Business Problem  

---

### 💼 Our Challenge as CFOs & Hedge Fund Managers  
We need a **timely, actionable view of where the economy is heading** — to guide budgeting, hiring, capital allocation, and portfolio positioning.  
But traditional macro analysis is either **delayed**, **vague**, or **binary** — leaving leadership teams and investment desks uncertain and reactive.

- Outlooks like “risk of recession increasing” offer **no concrete playbook**  
- Binary models miss the **spectrum of economic environments**  
- Without knowing the next regime, it’s easy to overextend or underreact

---

### 🔍 Why This Is a Problem  

> No clear regime = No clear playbook.

- CFOs risk setting budgets that don’t align with reality  
- Fund managers may **misallocate capital** at key turning points  
- Firms miss strategic opportunities or overcommit in fragile quarters  
- Timing errors compound when leading indicators are misread  

---

### ✅ The Strategic Opportunity  

> What if we could **confidently classify** the next macro regime — and understand the **signals driving it**?

- **Boom** → deploy capital, scale teams  
- **Stability** → stay the course  
- **Slowdown** → rebalance exposures, hold back investments  
- **Recession** → de-risk, preserve cash, hedge downside  

That’s the promise of our pipeline:  
📊 A hybrid system that forecasts macro indicators, predicts the next regime, and shows **why** it’s changing — all in time to act.

## 🧹 Slide 5: Data Collection & Preparation  

| Step         | Details                                                      |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Datasets     | `lags.csv`, `Prediction_Indicators.csv`, `Regime_Labels.csv` |
| Alignment    | Merged on `observation_date`, cleaned missing/nulls          |
| Final Set    | 30+ indicators (labor, housing, finance, etc.), 1970–2025     |

📌 Used mean imputation, dropped all-null columns, and retained quarterly structure

---

## 🛠️ Slide 6: Feature Engineering  

- 🔁 Lags for all variables (1Q to 4Q)  
- 📊 4-quarter **rolling mean**, **standard deviation**, **percent change**  
- 🧮 Derived Features:  
  - Fiscal Stress = Deficit × Interest Rate  
  - Inflation Gap = PPI – CPI  
  - Jobs Momentum = Employment / ΔUnemployment  
  - Inventory Ratio = Inventories / Retail Sales  
- ⚠️ Binary macro-stress flags from economic thresholds  

📌 Visuals: Correlation matrix (raw vs engineered), regime overlay on smoothed trends

## 🧠 Slide 7: Regime Labeling Logic  

> Rule-based classification of each quarter using key macro indicators

| Regime      | Criteria Highlights                             |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Boom        | Strong GDP + Jobs, low Unemployment              |
| Stability   | Neutral/slightly growing trends                  |
| Slowdown    | Rising Unemployment, falling production          |
| Recession   | GDP decline, consumption + labor weakness        |

📌 Applied thresholds to GDP, Unemployment, Capacity Utilization, and more

---

## 🕰️ Slide 8: Historical Pattern Analysis  

- Focused regime analysis on key downturns: **1974–75, 1980, 2008, 2020**  
- Explored how indicators behaved *before, during, and after* regime shifts  
- Identified early-warning signal combinations  

📌 Visuals: Timeline plots of GDP, Unemployment, CPI with regime overlays

## 🔮 Slide 9: Forecasting Macroeconomic Indicators  

| Forecasting Tool | Use Case Example                              |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **VAR**          | Co-moving indicators (e.g. GDP + Unemployment) |
| **Prophet**      | Seasonal trends: Jobs, Retail Sales            |
| **XGBoostRegressor** | Nonlinear indicators: Credit, Inventory Ratios |

- Sliding window approach for each variable  
- Forecasts 4 quarters ahead → saved as `future_forecasts_df`  

📌 Visuals: Actual vs Forecast lines, Prophet decomposition components

## 🧩 Slide 10: Regime Classification on Forecasted Inputs  

> Predict the economic regime based on **forecasted indicators**

| Step                 | Detail                              |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Classifier Input     | Forecasted macro features           |
| Output               | Regime label + probability per class|
| Result File          | `regime_predictions.csv`            |

📌 Visuals: Forecasted regime timeline (2024–2026), class probability bar charts

---

## 🤖 Slide 11: Retrospective Classifier Training  

- Trained **XGBoostClassifier** on lagged macro indicators  
- Used **SMOTE** for class balancing (Recession & Slowdown underrepresented)  
- Evaluated using a **sliding window** approach

📌 Visuals:  
- Confusion matrix  
- SHAP bar plots (global)

## 📊 Slide 13: Evaluation Strategy  

| Metric             | What It Tells Us                          |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Accuracy / F1      | Core classification performance           |
| Confusion Matrix   | Where regimes are most misclassified      |

## 💼 Slide 14: Business Recommendations  

1. Use regime forecasts in **budgeting & planning cycles**  
2. Alert leadership to **transition risks** (e.g. from Boom → Slowdown)  
3. Integrate SHAP findings in **strategic review decks**  
4. Deploy forecasts into a **live dashboard or alerting system**  
5. Simulate “what-if” economic shocks for resilience planning
