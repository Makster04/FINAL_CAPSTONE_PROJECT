## 🔷 SLIDE-BY-SLIDE POWERPOINT STRUCTURE

---

### **1. Title Slide**
**Slide Title**: *Economic Regime Forecasting Model*  
**Subtitle**: *Probabilistic Predictions of Boom, Stability, Slowdown, or Recession*

**Content**:
- Your name & affiliation (e.g. Capstone Project — Spring 2025)
- Date
- Optional: logo, theme image (e.g. stylized economic dashboard or U.S. flag with data overlay)

---

### **2. Problem Statement — Why This Matters**
**Title**: “Why Forecasting the Economy Isn’t a Yes/No Question”

**Bullet Points**:
- Most forecasts say “Recession” or “Not” — that’s too simplistic
- What we need: **“What’s the probability of each economic regime next quarter?”**
- This helps businesses and policymakers prepare for a **range of outcomes**, not just one

**Visual**:
- Chart: Show a dial or bar with Recession = 70%, Stability = 20%, Boom = 10%

---

### **3. Stakeholder Impact**
**Title**: “Who Uses This and Why It’s Valuable”

| Stakeholder | Use Case |
|-------------|----------|
| Hedge Funds | Risk-based asset allocation |
| CFOs & Strategy | Adjust hiring, inventory, or CapEx |
| Government Analysts | Early-warning for macro policy shifts |
| Fintech Tools | Embed insights into dashboards/APIs |

**Visual**:
- Icons/logos for each group (bank, factory, gov building, dashboard)

---

### **4. Data Sources and Indicators**
**Title**: “What Signals Are We Using?”

**Content**: Organize by category

| Type | Indicators |
|------|------------|
| **Leading** | Confidence, Yield Curve, Jobless Claims |
| **Coincident** | Industrial Production, Capacity Utilization |
| **Lagging** | GDP, Unemployment, Inflation |

**Visual**:
- Heatmap or quadrant-style visual: leading vs lagging on one axis, policy vs market on the other

---

### **5. How We Define Economic Regimes**
**Title**: “Defining Boom vs Recession Without NBER”

**Table**:

| Regime | GDP | CU | Unemployment |
|--------|-----|----|--------------|
| Boom | >3% | >80% | Low & falling |
| Stability | 1–3% | ~75–80% | Stable |
| Slowdown | 0–1% | Falling | Rising |
| Recession | <0% (2+ qtrs) | <75% | High |

**Visual**:
- Color-coded quadrant or decision tree

📌 Say: “We used a **transparent, rule-based method** to assign regime labels, so we don’t rely on retrospective NBER calls.”

---

### **6. Feature Engineering**
**Title**: “From Raw Indicators to Predictive Signals”

**Bullet Points**:
- Create 1–4 quarter lags
- Build rolling stats: % change, std, mean
- Derived features:
  - Yield Spread = 10Y – 2Y
  - Fiscal Stress = Deficit × Rate
  - Jobs Momentum = ΔJobs / ΔUnemployment

**Visual**:
- Pipeline graphic: Raw → Lagged → Derived → Model input

---

### **7. Time-Aware Modeling Pipeline**
**Title**: “How the Model Thinks About Time”

**Diagram**:
```
Quarter t-4 → t-3 → t-2 → t-1 →  [Model] → Predict regime at t
```

📌 Emphasize:
- Inputs are **sequential** and lagged
- Model never sees the future — respects the real-time decision-making process

---

### **8. Probabilistic Model Outputs**
**Title**: “We Don’t Just Say Recession — We Say *How Likely*”

**Table Example**:

| Boom | Stability | Slowdown | Recession |
|------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| 8%   | 20%       | 25%      | **47%**   |

📌 Say: “A 47% recession risk gives more nuance than a binary yes/no. This matters for planning.”

**Visual**:
- Stacked bar or radar chart of probabilities

---

### **9. Model Candidates + Explainability**
**Title**: “Models That Output Probabilities + Interpretability”

| Model | Used? | Predict Prob? | SHAP Support |
|-------|-------|----------------|---------------|
| Logistic Regression (Softmax) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| XGBoost / RF | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| LSTM (optional) | 🚧 | ✅ | Limited |

📌 Say: “We prioritized interpretable models with `predict_proba()` outputs. SHAP shows why a recession was predicted.”

---

### **10. Evaluation — Classic & Time-Aware**
**Title**: “We Measure *Accuracy* and *Timing*”

Split this slide in two columns:

**Left (Traditional)**:
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, AUC

**Right (Time-Aware)**:
- ⏱️ **Lead Time Detection**: how early we predict regime shifts  
- 🔁 **Transition vs Stability F1**: performance during shocks  
- 📉 **Prediction Volatility**: avoid overreacting

**Visual**: F1 curve over time or regime switch plot

---

### **11. Explainability with SHAP**
**Title**: “What Drives the Model’s Forecast?”

**Bullet Points**:
- SHAP shows top drivers (e.g. Yield Curve, Confidence, Jobs)
- Can explain each quarter’s prediction to stakeholders

**Visuals**:
- SHAP bar chart (global importance)
- Timeline chart showing SHAP value evolution over time

---

### **12. Alerting & Integration**
**Title**: “How It Becomes Actionable”

**Use Cases**:
- Dashboards show regime probabilities
- Email/SMS alerts if `P(Recession) > 60%`
- Embedded in ERP or investor tools

**Visual**:
- Mock dashboard screenshot with gauge and alerts

---

### **13. Business Impact Summary**
**Title**: “Why It’s Useful for Real-World Decisions”

**By Regime:**

| Regime | Business Action |
|--------|-----------------|
| Boom | Expand, hire, invest |
| Stability | Maintain status quo |
| Slowdown | Caution, review budgets |
| Recession | Cut costs, delay investment |

📌 Say: “We turn regime probability into **decision frameworks**.”

---

### **14. Final Takeaways**
**Title**: “What We Built — And Where It Goes Next”

✅ Transparent regime labeling  
✅ Full time-aware forecasting pipeline  
✅ Probabilistic + interpretable output  
✅ Real-world integration potential

**Optional bullets**:
- Expandable to state-level or global use  
- Add LSTM or attention models  
- Deploy as dashboard or API
