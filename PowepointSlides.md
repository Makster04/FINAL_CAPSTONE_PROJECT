## ✅ **Slide 3: Why This Model Matters**

- Traditional macro models output **probability scores** or binary forecasts — hard to explain, harder to act on.  
- ARMIS produces **discrete, interpretable regime predictions** (*Boom, Stability, Slowdown, Recession*).  
- Uses only **lagged indicators**, enabling forward planning with no future data leakage.  
- Offers a better framework for quarterly decision-making.

**In addition:**  
- Combines **rule-based regime labeling + SHAP** for transparency  
- Helps organizations **prepare for regime shifts**, not just react  
- Human-readable, plug-and-play into dashboards and strategy sessions

---

## 🧠 **Slide 4: Business Problem**

> “What macroeconomic regime is the U.S. economy entering next — and what signals are driving that transition?”

### 🧩 The Challenge:
- Binary recession detectors miss nuance (Boom vs Mild Slowdown)  
- Probabilistic outputs (e.g., “72% recession risk”) lack interpretability  
- Lack of signal attribution limits trust and actionability  

### ✅ The Solution:
ARMIS reframes the problem:
- Classifies the **next quarter** into one of four **regimes**
- Uses only **past 4 quarters** of macro data
- Explains **why** a regime is forecast using SHAP and historical validation

## 👥 **Slide 5: Who Benefits from This Model?**

### 🎯 Primary Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Benefit |
|-------------|---------|
| 💼 CFOs & Executives | Use forecasts for hiring, cost management, and strategy |
| 📈 Portfolio Managers | Rotate assets based on regime exposure |
| 🧠 Economists & Strategists | Craft outlooks, run scenarios, explain trends |

---

### 🌐 Secondary Users

| User | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| 🧮 Data Science Teams | Integrate regime classification into internal models or alerts |
| 📱 Fintech Platforms | Display economic regimes in retail investment apps |
| 📢 Media & Think Tanks | Communicate the macro landscape with clear narrative context |

> 🗣 “Instead of saying *maybe recession*, we say *Slowdown ahead — here’s what’s driving it*.”

## 🧹 **Slide 6: Data Preparation & Preprocessing**

### 📊 Macroeconomic Data Sources (1970–2025)

| Theme           | Examples                                    |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Confidence       | Consumer & Business Confidence (OECD)       |
| Labor Market     | Unemployment Rate, Jobs Added, Participation |
| Inflation        | CPI, PPI, Oil Prices                        |
| Real Economy     | Durable Goods Orders, Capacity Utilization  |
| Liquidity        | Real M2 Money Stocks                        |
| Interest Rates   | Fed Funds, Yield Spreads (10Y–2Y)           |
| Fiscal & Credit  | Deficit % GDP, Credit Conditions            |
| Volatility       | VIX, Bond Yields                            |

---

### 🔧 Preprocessing Steps:
- Merged **leading, coincident, and lagging** indicators by quarter  
- Engineered new signals:
  - `Jobs_Momentum = ΔJobs / ΔUnemployment`
  - `Fiscal_Stress = Deficit × Fed Funds Rate`
  - `Inflation Gap = PPI – CPI`
- Applied:
  - **Z-score normalization**
  - **1–4 quarter lags**
  - **Rolling mean, std, and % change**
- Final dataset: 250+ temporal features per quarter

---

## 🧠 **Slide 7: Regime Classification Architecture**

### 🧩 Modeling Goal:
> Predict the **next quarter’s economic regime** using **only past data**  
(*Realistic for policy, investment, and business planning*)

---

### ⚙️ Model Pipeline:

| Component         | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Input**         | Lagged macro indicators (1–4Q lags, rolling stats) |
| **Output**        | Regime class: Boom, Stability, Slowdown, Recession |
| **Split**         | Chronological (Train: 1970–2010, Test: 2011–2024) |
| **Models Tested** | Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest |
| **Labels**        | Based on GDP, Jobs, Industrial Production, etc. (rule-based) |

✅ SMOTE used for class balance  
✅ LabelEncoder for interpretable SHAP plots

## 🔍 **Slide 8: Interpretability Transparency & Metrics**

### 📊 Interpretable by Design

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Rule-Based Labels** | Transparent regime definition (not a black box) |
| **SHAP (Global)** | Ranks most important signals for each regime |
| **SHAP (Local)** | Explains why a regime was predicted for a specific quarter |
| **Transition Comparison** | Aligns with NBER recessions (2001, 2008, 2020) |

---

### 💡 Example (Recession Forecast – Q4 2024):
| Feature                | Impact |
|------------------------|--------|
| Jobless Claims ↑       | +0.29  |
| Durable Goods ↓        | +0.22  |
| Credit Conditions ↓    | +0.19  |

> 🔦 *“Recession signal driven by worsening credit, weak durable demand, and layoffs”*

---

## 📤 **Slide 9: Sample Output from the Model**

### 📆 Forecasted Regimes (Real Output)

| Quarter   | Predicted Regime | Confidence |
|-----------|------------------|------------|
| 2025 Q2   | Stability         | 75%        |
| 2025 Q3   | Slowdown          | 68%        |
| 2025 Q4   | Recession         | 72%        |
| 2026 Q1   | Recession         | 65%        |

---

- Each prediction includes **class probability** and **SHAP-based driver explanation**  
- *Can be embedded in a dashboard or alert system (e.g., “Recession likely, 72% confidence”)*

---

## 🧪 **Slide 10: Evaluation & Validation**

### 🧾 Metrics Used

| Metric               | Notes |
|----------------------|-------|
| Accuracy, Precision, Recall | Per class — especially for *Recession* |
| F1 Score             | Weighted and macro-averaged |
| Confusion Matrix     | Showed strong separation between Stability and Recession |
| Transition Matrix    | Regime shift timing vs actual events |

---

### 📉 Retrospective Validation  
- Tested against **NBER-defined recessions**:  
  - 2001 (Dot-com Bust)  
  - 2008 (GFC)  
  - 2020 (COVID)  
- ARMIS regime calls **aligned with known shifts**  
- Lead-time evaluation confirms **early detection of downturns**

---

## 💼 **Slide 11: Business Recommendations**

1. 📊 Integrate ARMIS into **internal economic dashboards**  
2. 🔔 Set regime-based triggers (e.g., alert if *Slowdown → Recession*)  
3. 📡 Deploy via API for external data platforms or economic tools  
4. 🧠 Use SHAP outputs to explain strategic decisions to stakeholders  
5. 📈 Run “what-if” analyses by tweaking key indicators (e.g., oil shock, job cuts)

> ARMIS makes regime forecasting **actionable and explainable.**

---

## 🔮 **Slide 12: Next Steps**

1. 🧠 **Forecast inputs** using ARIMA or Seq2Seq → predict regimes further out (Q+2, Q+3)  
2. 📊 Build a **dashboard or alerting tool** for end users  
3. 🧬 Extend to **sector-level regime classification** (e.g., housing, retail, labor)  
4. 🧪 Run **scenario tests**:  
   > “If unemployment rises 1% and CPI spikes, what regime do we enter?”

---

## ❓ **Slide 13: Any Questions Because...**  
> The future isn’t binary — it’s a regime. And **ARMIS helps you forecast it.**
