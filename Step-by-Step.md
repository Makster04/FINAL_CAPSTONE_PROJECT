---

# ✅ Step-by-Step Capstone Roadmap (Time-Series Enhanced + Feature-Complete)

## 📍 1. **Define the Problem & Scope**
### 🎯 Goal  
> Predict the next quarter’s economic state (**Boom**, **Stability**, **Slowdown**, or **Recession**) using lagged macroeconomic indicators.

### ✅ Deliverables  
- One-sentence predictive framing:  
  > “Using macroeconomic indicators from the past 4 quarters, can we predict the economic regime of the upcoming quarter?”
- Business value rationale:  
  > This model empowers stakeholders to navigate macro uncertainty by proactively adjusting financial, investment, and policy decisions.
- Emphasize:  
  - 4-class multi-class framing  
  - Time-aware pipeline  
  - Use cases: investors, CFOs, policymakers, media

---

## 📍 2. **Data Collection**
### 🎯 Sources  
- **FRED**: GDP, CPI, PPI, unemployment, jobs, rates, deficit, housing, yield spread  
- **OECD**: Consumer and Business Confidence  
- **NY Fed**: Global Supply Chain Pressure Index  
- **NBER**: Recession dating  
- **BEA, BLS, World Bank**: Official macro indicators  

### ✅ Deliverables  
- `data/` folder with `.csv` files or `data_pull.py` (e.g., via `fredapi`, `pandas_datareader`)  
- `.gitignore` for large files  
- Data dictionary in `README.md` or notebook  
- ✅ Visual map of sources → features  

---

## 📍 3. **Data Understanding & Exploration**
### 🎯 Tasks  
- Clean time columns, align frequencies (e.g., quarterly)  
- Visualize trends, breakpoints (e.g., 2008, 2020)  
- Identify missing data & imputation needs  
- ✅ Analyze:
  - Seasonality
  - Autocorrelation (ACF/PACF)
  - Momentum / volatility  

### ✅ Deliverables  
- EDA notebook with visuals (line plots, boxplots, histograms)  
- ✅ Timeline showing historical shocks (recessions, COVID)  
- ✅ SHAP-style or exploratory feature-target insights  

---

## 📍 4. **Label Engineering**
### 🎯 Label Options  
- **Rule-Based**:
  - Boom: GDP > 3%, low unemployment  
  - Stability: 1–3% GDP, neutral indicators  
  - Slowdown: GDP ~0–1%, rising unemployment  
  - Recession: GDP < 0 two quarters, NBER-flagged  
- ✅ Option: Overlay unsupervised clustering to validate regimes

### ✅ Deliverables  
- `labeling_logic.py` script with modular logic  
- Visual: economic regime timeline (1970–2023)  
- ✅ Regime frequency histogram (check class balance per decade)  

---

## 📍 5. **Feature Engineering**
### 🎯 Techniques  
- Lagged features: 1–4 quarters  
- Rolling means, % changes, differences  
- ✅ Derived features:
  - Fiscal Stress Index = (Deficit % of GDP) × (Interest Rate)  
  - Yield Curve Spread  
  - Momentum flags, volatility proxies  
- Normalize or z-score scale

### ✅ Deliverables  
- `features.py` or notebook  
- ✅ Feature importance heatmap / correlation matrix  
- ✅ SHAP bar chart preview (early-stage explainability)  

---

## 📍 6. **Train-Test Split (Time-Aware)**
### 🎯 Strategy  
- Chronological split (e.g., Train: 1970–2010 | Test: 2011–2023)  
- ✅ Rolling forecasting window (simulate quarterly prediction)  
- Avoid leakage: no peeking into future indicators  

### ✅ Deliverables  
- Timeline visualization of train/test split  
- ✅ Sliding window logic for sequential models  
- ✅ Diagram of forecasting pipeline: past → predict next  

---

## 📍 7. **Baseline & Modeling**
### 🎯 Models  
- Baseline: **Softmax Logistic Regression** (interpretable)  
- Tree-based: **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, **LightGBM**  
- Deep time models: **LSTM/GRU**, optional **Temporal Attention**  
- ✅ Optional pre-modeling with **ARIMA / Prophet** for forecasting inputs  

### ✅ Deliverables  
- `modeling.ipynb`  
- Comparison table (Accuracy, F1, AUC by class)  
- ✅ Time-aware model comparison (with vs. without lags)  
- ✅ Hyperparameter tuning for class imbalance  

---

## 📍 8. **Model Evaluation**
### 🎯 Metrics  
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 per class  
- Confusion Matrix  
- ROC-AUC (one-vs-rest for multi-class)  
- ✅ *Time-Series Metrics*:
  - Accuracy per year  
  - Timeliness (e.g., lead time on Recession)  
  - Sequence-level accuracy (for LSTM)  
  - Class drift: overpredict Boom? Miss Recession?

### ✅ Deliverables  
- Confusion matrix + bar charts  
- ✅ Line chart: F1-score over time  
- ✅ Timeliness heatmap (actual vs predicted class per quarter)  
- Error analysis + interpretation  

---

## 📍 9. **Business Impact & Recommendations**
### 🎯 Focus  
- Use cases per stakeholder:  
  - Investors: Asset allocation  
  - CFOs: Capex/Hiring/Planning  
  - Policy: Monetary/fiscal levers  
- ✅ Limitations: data delay, geopolitical shocks  
- ✅ Decision thresholds for high-confidence use  

### ✅ Deliverables  
- Summary narrative + actionable insights  
- ✅ Use-case matrix (stakeholder → prediction → decision)
