Great — now that you’ve laid out the full ARMIS pipeline, let’s directly answer your question **in the context of each stage**:

---

### 🧠 Q: **“When would I be forecasting the regime, and would I use different indicators?”**  
**A: You begin forecasting at Step 7 (“Modeling Approaches”), and yes — you use different indicators than you used for labeling.**

---

### ✅ **Clarified Workflow Breakdown**

| Step | Purpose | Indicators Used |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| **3. Regime Definition & Labeling** | Create **target variable** (`Regime_Label`) based on **rule-based logic** | ✳️ GDP, Unemployment, Capacity Utilization, Industrial Production, Jobless Claims |
| **4–6. EDA + Feature Engineering** | Build the **inputs/features** for forecasting future regimes | ✅ **Prior 1–4 quarter lags** of leading/coincident indicators (e.g., Consumer Confidence, Housing Starts, PPI, VIX, M2, Durable Goods, etc.) |
| **7. Modeling** | Train model to predict **future regime** (1 quarter ahead) based on past data | ✅ Uses the lagged + derived features |
| **8. Forecasting Logic** | Apply model to predict the **next quarter’s regime** | ✅ Same features as above |

---

### 🎯 So you are absolutely correct to **use different indicators**:
- The **rule-based indicators** are for **retrospective classification** (e.g., did this quarter *end up* being a Boom?)
- The **predictive indicators** (leading + lagged features) are what your model uses to **forecast future regimes**

### 🛠 Example of Forecasting Setup:

Assume you're at 2023 Q3 and want to forecast 2023 Q4:

| Quarter | Indicator Set | Usage |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| 2022 Q3 | Consumer Confidence, Housing Starts, etc. | Lag-4 |
| 2022 Q4 | Same indicators | Lag-3 |
| 2023 Q1 | Same indicators | Lag-2 |
| 2023 Q2 | Same indicators | Lag-1 |
| 👉 **2023 Q3** | Model input (features) |
| 👉 **2023 Q4** | Model output (label = predicted regime) |

---

### 🧪 Want to double-check?

You could run a quick correlation or SHAP analysis after model training to see:
- Which lagged indicators most strongly predict *each regime*
- Whether the forecastable regimes align with their theoretical drivers (e.g., VIX spike before recessions, job gains before booms, etc.)

---

### ✅ TL;DR

- Yes, you use **different indicators** for forecasting (Steps 4–8) than for rule-based labeling (Step 3).
- Forecasting uses **lagged + derived features** from macro indicators.
- Labeling is grounded in a few trusted **real-time/cyclical metrics** like GDP, jobs, and capacity utilization.
