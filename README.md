## 🧠 Overview  
**Example Question:**  
<<<<<<< HEAD
> “Given the last 4 quarters of economic data, will the next quarter indicate an **Economic Boom**, **Neutral Stability**, **Economic Slowdown**, or a full **Recession**?”

This model forecasts macroeconomic regimes using **lagged macroeconomic indicators** and **time-aware machine learning**, offering actionable early warnings to financial, corporate, and policy stakeholders.
=======
> “Given the last 4 quarters of economic data, what is the **probability** that the next quarter will be a **Recession**, **Slowdown**, **Stability**, or **Boom**?”

This model predicts macroeconomic regimes using **lagged economic indicators** and **time-aware machine learning**, delivering **class probabilities** (e.g. “75% chance of Recession”) instead of just hard labels. It provides early-warning signals for financial, corporate, and policy decision-making.

## 🔥 Why It’s Marketable  

<<<<<<< HEAD
- **Economic Uncertainty**: Inflation, interest rates, and shocks make forecasting a necessity.  
- **Actionable Early Warnings**: Anticipating turns helps avoid late or overreactions.  
- **4-Class Advantage**: Goes beyond binary “recession or not” to **Boom**, **Stability**, **Slowdown**, and **Recession**.  
=======
- 📉 **Quantified Recession Risk**: Don’t just flag a recession — assign it a **probability**.  
- 📊 **Beyond Binary**: Models four economic states, not just “recession or not.”  
- 🛡️ **Risk-Aware Decisions**: Use probability thresholds to trigger budget, hiring, or investment actions.

## ⚙️ How It Works  

<<<<<<< HEAD
### 🔍 **Input Features (All Lagged)**  
Includes 1–4 quarter lags, rolling windows, and percent changes for all variables:

| Category | Indicators |
|----------|------------|
| **Output & Labor** | GDP Growth Rate (QoQ, YoY), Jobs Added, Unemployment Rate, Labor Force Participation |
| **Inflation & Prices** | CPI, PPI, Oil Prices |
| **Confidence & Sentiment** | Consumer Confidence, Business Confidence, PMI |
| **Policy & Rates** | Federal Funds Rate, Fiscal Deficit (% GDP), Yield Curve Spread (10Y–2Y) |
| **Production & Supply** | Industrial Production Index, Capacity Utilization, Housing Starts, Supply Chain Pressure Index |
| **Market & Trade** | Broad Dollar Index, Initial Jobless Claims |

💡 Derived Features:  
- **Fiscal Stress Index** = (Deficit % GDP) × (Interest Rate)  
- **Momentum Flags** = Change in key indicators over prior 2–4 quarters

---

## 🎯 Target Labels (No NBER Required)  
Generated using **rule-based logic** directly from macro indicators:

| Regime Label        | Rule-Based Definition |
|---------------------|-----------------------|
| **Boom**            | GDP > 3%, rising jobs, strong sentiment & capacity use >80% |
| **Stability**       | GDP 1–3%, steady labor/inflation indicators |
| **Slowdown**        | GDP ~0–1%, falling confidence, rising unemployment |
| **Recession**       | GDP < 0 for 2+ quarters, rising unemployment, falling production/capacity |

🧠 *You can also cluster historical quarters (KMeans, GMM, HMM) to validate or refine these labels.*

---

## ⏱️ Time-Series Modeling Approach  

Time-aware pipeline fully respects macroeconomic lags and structure.

### 🧰 Core Techniques:
- Lagged Variables (1–4 quarters)
- Rolling Means, % Changes
- Sliding Windows (e.g. last 4 quarters → predict next)
- Chronological Train/Test Split (e.g. Train: 1970–2010, Test: 2011–2023)

### ⚙️ Optional Advanced Time Models:
- **LSTM / GRU**: Deep learning for sequential dependencies  
- **Prophet / ARIMA**: Forecast key indicators ahead of classification  
- **Temporal Attention**: Learn which past signals drove predictions

---

## 🧪 Model Types  

- ✅ **Softmax Logistic Regression**: Baseline, interpretable  
- ✅ **Random Forest / XGBoost / LightGBM**: Nonlinear + high performance  
- ✅ **LSTM / Temporal CNN**: For sequential forecasting  
- ✅ **SHAP / LIME**: Interpretability across all models  

🎯 Prioritize low false negatives for **Recession** (critical decision threshold tuning)

---

## 📊 Data Sources  

- **FRED (St. Louis Fed)** – Core macro indicators  
- **OECD** – Confidence and sentiment indexes  
- **NY Fed** – Global Supply Chain Pressure  
- **BEA / BLS / Conference Board** – GDP, Jobs, Inflation, Production  

---

## 📈 Outputs  

- **Predicted Regime** for next quarter  
- **Probability Breakdown** per class  
- **Top Drivers** (SHAP or feature importances)  
- **Visualization** of predicted vs actual over time  
=======
### 🔍 **Input Features (Lagged & Derived)**  
All inputs are lagged or transformed versions of macroeconomic indicators:

| Category | Indicators |
|----------|------------|
| **Output & Labor** | GDP Growth, Jobs Added, Unemployment, Labor Participation |
| **Inflation & Prices** | CPI, PPI, Oil Prices |
| **Confidence & Sentiment** | Consumer/Business Confidence |
| **Policy & Rates** | Fed Funds Rate, Fiscal Deficit, Yield Curve Spread |
| **Production & Supply** | Industrial Production, Housing Starts, Capacity Use |
| **Markets & Trade** | Jobless Claims |

🔧 Derived features:
- **Rolling Means, % Changes**
- **Momentum Flags** (2–4 quarter deltas)
- **Fiscal Stress Index** = Deficit % GDP × Interest Rate

---

## 🏷️ Regime Labels (Rule-Based Logic)  

| Regime        | Definition |
|---------------|------------|
| **Boom**      | GDP > 3%, strong labor & sentiment, capacity > 80% |
| **Stability** | GDP 1–3%, balanced macro conditions |
| **Slowdown**  | GDP ~0–1%, confidence fading, unemployment rising |
| **Recession** | GDP < 0 for 2+ quarters, production & employment falling |

You can optionally validate/refine these with clustering (e.g. GMM, HMM, KMeans).

## 🧠 Modeling Strategy  

### 📦 Time-Series Structure  

- Input: Lagged windows of last 4 quarters  
- Output: Regime of next quarter  
- Train/Test: Chronological split (e.g. 1970–2010 vs. 2011–2023)  

### 🧰 Algorithms Used  

| Model | Probability Output? |
|-------|----------------------|
| Logistic Regression (Softmax) | ✅ |
| XGBoost / LightGBM / RF       | ✅ |
| LSTM / Temporal CNN           | ✅ via softmax |
| SHAP / LIME                   | 🔍 Explainability |

---

## 📈 Output Format  

Each prediction includes:

| Boom | Stability | Slowdown | Recession |
|------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| 8%   | 20%       | 25%      | **47%**   |

🧠 **Interpretation**: Next quarter has a **47% chance of recession** and **25% chance of slowdown** → actionable risk level.

Visual outputs:
- 📊 Recession probability over time
- 🌈 Stacked area chart of regime probabilities
- 🔍 SHAP plots of top signal drivers

- Add flags to scenario planning dashboards  

```python
if probs[:, 3] > 0.6:
    trigger_recession_alert()
```
