# 📈 Recession Risk Forecasting Model (Continuous, Time-Aware)  

### *(Lagged Macroeconomic Indicators → Forecasted Economic Fragility Score)*  

---

## 🧠 Overview  
**Example Question:**  
> “Based on the last 4 quarters of macroeconomic data, what’s the **recession risk level** for the upcoming quarter — 15%, 42%, or 75%?”
> "What direction is the economy going to turn because I need to know whether I should sell my stocks"


This model predicts a **continuous recession probability-like score** using **lagged economic indicators**. Rather than hard classifications (e.g. “Recession” vs “Stability”), it learns subtle patterns of economic fragility to generate **risk levels** — enabling earlier, smoother, and more actionable macro signals.

---

## 🔥 Why It’s Marketable  

- 📉 **Smooth Recession Forecasting**: Skip binary “yes/no” flags — predict **how likely** a recession is.  
- 🧠 **Interpretability-First**: Models can show **why** risk is rising via SHAP.  
- 📊 **Quantitative Risk Monitoring**: Track macro deterioration in real-time with continuous signals.  
- 🕒 **Early Warning System**: Great for stakeholders who care about **lead time** more than classification.

## 🎯 Target Users  

- **Asset Managers & Hedge Funds**: Macro overlays for portfolio rebalancing  
- **CFOs & Economists**: Scenario planning based on economic risk scores  
- **Policymakers**: Calibrate fiscal/monetary tools using leading fragility indicators  
- **Fintech & Dashboards**: Embed risk gauges and time-series drivers into macro dashboards

## ⚙️ How It Works  

### 🔍 **Input Features: Lagged + Engineered Macroeconomic Indicators**  

| Theme | Indicators |
|-------|------------|
| **Confidence** | Consumer & Business Confidence |
| **Labor** | Jobs Added, Unemployment Rate, Labor Force Participation |
| **Inflation** | CPI, PPI |
| **Rates** | Fed Funds Rate, Yield Curve Spread |
| **Real Economy** | Housing Starts, Durable Goods Orders, Capacity Utilization |
| **Production** | Industrial Production |
| **Fiscal & Credit** | Deficit % GDP, Corporate Bond Spreads |
| **Liquidity** | Real M2 Stocks |
| **Inventory & Sales** | Business Inventories, Retail Sales |
| **Volatility** | VIX (Volatility Index) |

### 🔧 Derived Features  
- **Fiscal Stress Index** = Deficit % GDP × Interest Rate  
- **Inflation Gap** = PPI – CPI  
- **Jobs Momentum** = ΔJobs / ΔUnemployment  
- **Liquidity Shock** = QoQ ΔM2  
- **Inventory-to-Sales Ratio**  
- **Volatility Shock** = ΔVIX  
- **Yield Curve Inversion** = 10Y – 2Y Spread

## 🛠️ Modeling Strategy  

### 🔁 Time-Series Forecasting Logic  
- Input: Past **4 quarters** of lagged macro indicators  
- Output: **Next quarter’s recession risk score** (e.g. 0.67 = 67% risk)  
- Structure: **Sliding windows**, chronological train/test split  

### 🧰 Model Types  

| Model | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| **XGBoostRegressor / LightGBM** | Probabilistic regression + SHAP |
| **LSTM / TCN Regressor** | Sequential models with memory |
| **Autoencoder / PCA** | Unsupervised “distance from stability” |
| **KMeans / Mahalanobis** | Fragility score via clustering or distance |
| **Bayesian Models** | Risk forecast + uncertainty intervals |

## 📈 Output Format  

Predictions are **continuous** risk levels per quarter:

| Quarter | Forecasted Recession Risk (%) |
|---------|-------------------------------|
| Q1 2024 | 18.3% |
| Q2 2024 | **45.7%** |
| Q3 2024 | **63.5%** |
| Q4 2024 | 70.2% |

🎯 **Interpretation**: Gradual uptick in risk → potential early warning → actionable insight.

Visuals:
- 📉 Line chart: Predicted risk vs NBER recessions  
- 📊 SHAP by quarter  
- ⏱️ Lead time to real downturns  
- 🔄 Smoothness metrics (volatility of forecast over time)

---

## 📊 Evaluation Strategy  

| Metric | Use |
|--------|-----|
| **RMSE / MAE / R²** | Fit to target proxy (if used) |
| **Correlation with GDP/NBER** | Alignment with real cycles |
| **Lead Time Evaluation** | Quarters of early warning |
| **Volatility Penalty** | Penalize jumpy predictions |
| **SHAP Attribution** | Interpret quarterly risk drivers |

---

## 🔄 Risk Alerts & Thresholds  

Configure alert bands:

| Risk Band | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------------|
| 0–25%     | Low risk       |
| 25–50%    | Moderate       |
| 50–75%    | High concern   |
| 75–100%   | Imminent danger |

```python
if forecasted_risk > 0.6:
    send_recession_alert()
```
