# 📈 Economic Turn Classification Model Using Economic Indicators  
### *(Supervised Multi-Class Time Series ML Model — No NBER Dependency)*  

---

## 🧠 Overview  
**Example Question:**  
> “Given the last 4 quarters of economic data, will the next quarter indicate an **Economic Boom**, **Neutral Stability**, **Economic Slowdown**, or a full **Recession**?”

This model forecasts macroeconomic regimes using **lagged macroeconomic indicators** and **time-aware machine learning**, offering actionable early warnings to financial, corporate, and policy stakeholders.

---

## 🔥 Why It’s Marketable  

- **Economic Uncertainty**: Inflation, interest rates, and shocks make forecasting a necessity.  
- **Actionable Early Warnings**: Anticipating turns helps avoid late or overreactions.  
- **4-Class Advantage**: Goes beyond binary “recession or not” to **Boom**, **Stability**, **Slowdown**, and **Recession**.  

---

## 🎯 Target Users  

- **Investors & Hedge Funds**: Dynamic asset allocation based on macro regime shifts  
- **Corporate Strategy Teams**: Scenario-based budgeting, hiring, capex planning  
- **Policy Analysts**: Time macro policies more proactively  
- **Fintech & Media**: Embed economic outlook into tools and dashboards

## ⚙️ How It Works  

### 🔍 **Input Features (All Lagged)**  
Includes 1–4 quarter lags, rolling windows, and percent changes for all variables:

| Category | Indicators |
|----------|------------|
| **Output & Labor** | GDP Growth Rate (QoQ, YoY), Jobs Added, Unemployment Rate, Labor Force Participation |
| **Inflation & Prices** | CPI, PPI, Oil Prices |
| **Confidence & Sentiment** | Consumer Confidence, Business Confidence, PMI |
| **Policy & Rates** | Federal Funds Rate, Fiscal Deficit (% GDP), Yield Curve Spread (10Y–2Y) |
| **Production & Supply** | Industrial Production Index, Capacity Utilization, Housing Starts, Supply Chain Pressure Index |
| **Market & Trade** | Broad Dollar Index, Initial Jobless Claims |

💡 Derived Features:  
- **Fiscal Stress Index** = (Deficit % GDP) × (Interest Rate)  
- **Momentum Flags** = Change in key indicators over prior 2–4 quarters

---

## 🎯 Target Labels (No NBER Required)  
Generated using **rule-based logic** directly from macro indicators:

| Regime Label        | Rule-Based Definition |
|---------------------|-----------------------|
| **Boom**            | GDP > 3%, rising jobs, strong sentiment & capacity use >80% |
| **Stability**       | GDP 1–3%, steady labor/inflation indicators |
| **Slowdown**        | GDP ~0–1%, falling confidence, rising unemployment |
| **Recession**       | GDP < 0 for 2+ quarters, rising unemployment, falling production/capacity |

🧠 *You can also cluster historical quarters (KMeans, GMM, HMM) to validate or refine these labels.*

## ⏱️ Time-Series Modeling Approach  

Time-aware pipeline fully respects macroeconomic lags and structure.

### 🧰 Core Techniques:
- Lagged Variables (1–4 quarters)
- Rolling Means, % Changes
- Sliding Windows (e.g. last 4 quarters → predict next)
- Chronological Train/Test Split (e.g. Train: 1970–2010, Test: 2011–2023)

### ⚙️ Optional Advanced Time Models:
- **LSTM / GRU**: Deep learning for sequential dependencies  
- **Prophet / ARIMA**: Forecast key indicators ahead of classification  
- **Temporal Attention**: Learn which past signals drove predictions

---

## 🧪 Model Types  

- ✅ **Softmax Logistic Regression**: Baseline, interpretable  
- ✅ **Random Forest / XGBoost / LightGBM**: Nonlinear + high performance  
- ✅ **LSTM / Temporal CNN**: For sequential forecasting  
- ✅ **SHAP / LIME**: Interpretability across all models  

🎯 Prioritize low false negatives for **Recession** (critical decision threshold tuning)

## 📊 Data Sources  

- **FRED (St. Louis Fed)** – Core macro indicators  
- **OECD** – Confidence and sentiment indexes  
- **NY Fed** – Global Supply Chain Pressure  
- **BEA / BLS / Conference Board** – GDP, Jobs, Inflation, Production  

---

## 📈 Outputs  

- **Predicted Regime** for next quarter  
- **Probability Breakdown** per class  
- **Top Drivers** (SHAP or feature importances)  
- **Visualization** of predicted vs actual over time
