Great move — pivoting to ARMIS makes your capstone more interpretable and classification-focused, which opens up lots of real-world applications.

To convert your **continuous recession risk model** into an **ARMIS-style discrete regime classifier**, here’s **what needs to change** in the project description:

---

## ✅ Key Conceptual Shift:

| From | To |
|------|----|
| Forecasting a **continuous probability-like score** (0–1) | Classifying into **discrete economic regimes** |
| “How risky is the economy next quarter?” | “What regime are we likely entering — Boom, Stability, Slowdown, or Recession?” |
| Regression + smooth signals | Multi-class classification |
| SHAP over continuous scores | SHAP over regime probability distribution |
| Risk bands (Low, Medium, High, Critical) | Regimes (Boom, Stability, Slowdown, Recession) |

# 📈 ARMIS: Automated Regime Modeling via Interpretable Signals  
### *(Lagged Economic Indicators → Forecasted Economic Regime)*  

---

## 🧠 Overview  
**Core Question:**  
> “Based on the last 4 quarters of macroeconomic data, which **economic regime** will the U.S. be in next quarter?”  
> “Are we headed for a Boom, Stability, Slowdown — or full Recession?”

**ARMIS** classifies the upcoming quarter into one of four interpretable economic states using time-lagged macro indicators. Instead of forecasting a risk score, it provides clear regime categories for planning and policy action.

---

## 🔥 Why It’s Marketable  

- ✅ **Human-Readable Output**: Discrete regimes are easy to understand and act on  
- 🧠 **Interpretable Signals**: SHAP shows what features pushed the model toward a regime  
- 🕒 **Lead-Time Friendly**: Uses only past data to emulate real-time planning  
- 📊 **Scenario Ready**: Stakeholders can ask: “What regime would we be in if unemployment rose?”

---

## 🎯 Target Users  

- **Asset Managers**: Portfolio hedging and exposure strategies  
- **Economists / CFOs**: Regime-based financial planning  
- **Policy Analysts**: Support monetary/fiscal intervention timing  
- **Fintechs / Dashboards**: Classify macro climate for end users

### 🧠 Derived Features  

| Feature | Formula |
|--------|---------|
| Fiscal Stress Index | Deficit × Fed Funds Rate |
| Jobs Momentum | ΔJobs / ΔUnemployment |
| Inflation Gap | PPI – CPI |
| Yield Spread | 10Y – 2Y |
| Volatility Shock | ΔVIX |
| Inventory Ratio | Inventories ÷ Retail Sales |

---

## 🎯 Regime Definitions (Target Classes)

| Regime | Macro Characteristics |
|--------|------------------------|
| **Boom** | High GDP growth, high capacity utilization, low and falling unemployment |
| **Stability** | Moderate growth, stable jobs and inflation |
| **Slowdown** | Growth slowing, job market softening |
| **Recession** | Contraction over 2+ quarters, rising unemployment, falling output |

📌 Regimes are assigned via **rule-based labeling** using historical data (e.g., GDP, CU, Unemployment thresholds)

---

## 🛠️ Modeling Strategy  

### ⏳ Time-Aware Classification

- Input = past 4 quarters of indicators  
- Output = 1 of 4 regimes for next quarter  
- Structure = sliding windows with **chronological split** (e.g. train: 1970–2010, test: 2011–2024)

---

### 🧰 Model Candidates

| Model | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| Logistic Regression (Softmax) | Baseline, fully interpretable |
| XGBoostClassifier | Nonlinear signal capture + SHAP |
| Random Forest | Robust with low tuning burden |
| LSTM / TCN | Optional: Sequence-aware but harder to interpret |

---

## 📈 Output Format  

| Quarter | Predicted Regime |
|---------|------------------|
| Q1 2024 | Stability |
| Q2 2024 | Slowdown |
| Q3 2024 | **Recession** |
| Q4 2024 | Recession |

📌 Confidence scores for each regime can also be extracted:  
→ Recession: 61% | Slowdown: 27% | Stability: 12% | Boom: 0%

---

## 📊 Evaluation Strategy  

### 📐 Classification Metrics  
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall (per class)  
- F1 Score for Recession vs others  
- Confusion Matrix  

### ⏱️ Time-Aware Validation  
- **Lead Time Detection**: Was a regime shift caught early?  
- **Transition Sensitivity**: Did the model predict upcoming regime switches?

---

## 📊 SHAP-Based Explainability  

- Global SHAP: Feature importance for each regime class  
- Local SHAP: What drove the Recession prediction in Q3 2024?

📌 Visuals:  
- SHAP Bar chart (global)  
- SHAP Timeline (driver change over time)

---

## 🧪 Historical Pattern Validation  

- Overlay model regimes with NBER-labeled recessions  
- Validate regime classifications in 2001, 2008, 2020  
- Build confidence in rule-based labeling + model logic

---
