# 📈 Economic Regime Forecasting Model (with Probabilistic Outputs)  
### *(Supervised Multi-Class Time Series ML Model — Recession Risk as %)*  

---

## 🧠 Overview  
**Example Question:**  
> “Given the last 4 quarters of economic data, what is the **probability** that the next quarter will be a **Recession**, **Slowdown**, **Stability**, or **Boom**?”

This model predicts macroeconomic regimes using **lagged economic indicators** and **time-aware machine learning**, delivering **class probabilities** (e.g. “75% chance of Recession”) instead of just hard labels. It provides early-warning signals for financial, corporate, and policy decision-making.

---

## 🔥 Why It’s Marketable  

- 📉 **Quantified Recession Risk**: Don’t just flag a recession — assign it a **probability**.  
- 📊 **Beyond Binary**: Models four economic states, not just “recession or not.”  
- 🛡️ **Risk-Aware Decisions**: Use probability thresholds to trigger budget, hiring, or investment actions.  

---

## 🎯 Target Users  

- **Investors & Hedge Funds**: Regime-based dynamic asset allocation  
- **CFOs & Strategy Teams**: Scenario planning based on probability-weighted outlooks  
- **Policy Analysts**: Early signals of recession or overheating to preemptively act  
- **Fintech / Data Products**: Embed macroeconomic probability insights into dashboards, APIs

## ⚙️ How It Works  

### 🔍 **Input Features (Lagged & Derived)**  
All inputs are lagged or transformed versions of macroeconomic indicators:

| Category | Indicators |
|----------|------------|
| **Output & Labor** | GDP Growth, Jobs Added, Unemployment, Labor Participation |
| **Inflation & Prices** | CPI, PPI, Oil Prices |
| **Confidence & Sentiment** | Consumer/Business Confidence |
| **Policy & Rates** | Fed Funds Rate, Fiscal Deficit, Yield Curve Spread |
| **Production & Supply** | Industrial Production, Housing Starts, Capacity Use |
| **Markets & Trade** | Jobless Claims |

🔧 Derived features:
- **Rolling Means, % Changes**
- **Momentum Flags** (2–4 quarter deltas)
- **Fiscal Stress Index** = Deficit % GDP × Interest Rate

---

## 🏷️ Regime Labels (Rule-Based Logic)  

| Regime        | Definition |
|---------------|------------|
| **Boom**      | GDP > 3%, strong labor & sentiment, capacity > 80% |
| **Stability** | GDP 1–3%, balanced macro conditions |
| **Slowdown**  | GDP ~0–1%, confidence fading, unemployment rising |
| **Recession** | GDP < 0 for 2+ quarters, production & employment falling |

You can optionally validate/refine these with clustering (e.g. GMM, HMM, KMeans).

## 🧠 Modeling Strategy  

### 📦 Time-Series Structure  

- Input: Lagged windows of last 4 quarters  
- Output: Regime of next quarter  
- Train/Test: Chronological split (e.g. 1970–2010 vs. 2011–2023)  

### 🧰 Algorithms Used  

| Model | Probability Output? |
|-------|----------------------|
| Logistic Regression (Softmax) | ✅ |
| XGBoost / LightGBM / RF       | ✅ |
| LSTM / Temporal CNN           | ✅ via softmax |
| SHAP / LIME                   | 🔍 Explainability |

---

## 📈 Output Format  

Each prediction includes:

| Boom | Stability | Slowdown | Recession |
|------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| 8%   | 20%       | 25%      | **47%**   |

🧠 **Interpretation**: Next quarter has a **47% chance of recession** and **25% chance of slowdown** → actionable risk level.

## 🔄 Probability-Based Alerts  

Configure alerts or thresholds:
- Send dashboard/email/SMS alert if `P(Recession) > 60%`
- Add flags to scenario planning dashboards  

```python
if probs[:, 3] > 0.6:
    trigger_recession_alert()
```
