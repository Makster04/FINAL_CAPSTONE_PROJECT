# FINAL_CAPSTONE_PROJECT

Great! Let's break this into actionable steps. Since this is a large-scale NLP project, I'll start by outlining the **core components** you need to implement, and we can dive deeper into specific parts as needed.

---

## **Core Implementation Steps**
### ðŸ”¹ **Step 1: Data Collection**
We need to gather relevant voter sentiment data from different sources. Do you want help with:
- **Twitter API (X API)** for real-time political discussions?
- **Reddit scraping** for in-depth discussions?
- **News article scraping** for political issues?
- **Google Trends API** for regional interest in topics?

ðŸ‘‰ **Let me know which data sources you want to prioritize!**

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Step 2: Data Preprocessing**
Once we collect the data, we need to clean and structure it. This involves:
- Removing **stopwords, special characters, and noise**.
- Tokenizing and **lemmatizing** the text.
- Using **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** to extract mentions of politicians, policies, or states.

ðŸ‘‰ **Would you like me to write a Python script for preprocessing raw text data?**

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Step 3: NLP Model Development**
1. **Topic Modeling (What are people talking about?)**
   - Using **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** or **BERTopic** to group discussions into topics.
   
2. **Sentiment Analysis (How do people feel about these topics?)**
   - Using **BERT, RoBERTa, or a fine-tuned LLM** to classify positive/negative/neutral sentiments.

3. **Time Series Analysis (How are these topics changing over time?)**
   - Using **LSTMs or Transformers** to track the evolution of concerns.

ðŸ‘‰ **Which model do you want to implement first? Topic modeling, sentiment analysis, or trend prediction?**

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Step 4: State-Specific Customization**
Since we are focusing on **swing states**, we should:
- **Segment data** by state using location-based filters (Twitter geotags, news sources, etc.).
- Create **customized models per state** to detect regional differences.

ðŸ‘‰ **Would you like a sample dataset with state-segmented voter sentiment data?**

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Step 5: Insights & Recommendation System**
1. **Prioritization Algorithm**: Assign weights to issues based on their frequency and sentiment.
2. **Visualization Dashboard**: Use **Streamlit, Dash, or Tableau** to display key topics for each state.
3. **Automated Reports**: Generate **weekly/daily** reports summarizing sentiment trends.

ðŸ‘‰ **Do you want a quick demo of how to set up a Streamlit dashboard for voter trends?**

---

### **Next Steps**
I can:
âœ… Write a **Python script** to collect and clean text data.  
âœ… Implement **Topic Modeling** or **Sentiment Analysis** first.  
âœ… Build a **basic Streamlit dashboard** to showcase findings.

**Let me know where you'd like to start, and I'll generate the necessary code for you!** ðŸš€
