# 📈 Macroeconomic Regime Forecasting  
### *Forecasting Future Economic States — One Quarter at a Time*

---

## 🧭 Overview

### Business and Data Understanding

---

### 💼 Business Problem  
CFOs and hedge fund managers need a clear and timely way to anticipate **macroeconomic turning points** — to guide budgeting, hiring, capital allocation, and portfolio exposure.

Traditional macro analysis is often **delayed, vague, or binary**, leading to:

- Missed transitions from expansion to contraction  
- Misaligned investment decisions  
- Outdated strategic plans mid-quarter

---

### 👥 Primary Stakeholders

| Stakeholder           | Use Case                                                     |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| CFOs & Executives       | Align budgets, hiring, and pricing with the macro cycle      |
| Hedge Fund Managers     | Adjust risk, rotate portfolios, and time entries/exits       |
| Strategy & IR Teams     | Tailor communication to regime trends and leading indicators |
| Central Bank Analysts   | Monitor shifts in economic momentum and sectoral stress      |
| Fintech/Product Teams   | Tag users’ environment with macro-contextual overlays        |

---

## 🎯 Objective  
Build a hybrid time-series forecasting pipeline that can:

- Forecast key macroeconomic indicators using appropriate models (VAR, Prophet, XGBoost)  
- Predict the **next macroeconomic regime**: Boom, Stability, Slowdown, or Recession  
- Provide **interpretable outputs** through SHAP and historical timelines  
- Enable leadership teams to act *before* transitions occur

---

## 📊 Data Understanding  

### 📁 Data Sources

- `lags.csv`: Pre-processed macroeconomic features and engineered lags  
- `Prediction_Indicators.csv`: Raw macroeconomic signals (labor, housing, consumer finance, etc.)  
- `Regime_Labels.csv`: Rule-based regime classifications per quarter  

### 🔧 Data Preparation Highlights

- Merge datasets on `observation_date`  
- Drop duplicate and null-only columns  
- Impute missing values with column means  
- Final dataset: 30+ indicators, 250+ features, quarterly from 1970 to 2025  

**Tools/Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `statsmodels`, `prophet`, `xgboost`, `shap`, `sklearn`

---

## 🏗️ Modeling Approach

---

### 🔁 Step 1: Feature Engineering

- **Lag Features**: 1 to 4 quarters per macro variable  
- **Rolling Stats**: 4-quarter rolling mean, std, and % change  
- **Derived Metrics**:  
  - *Fiscal Stress* = Deficit × Interest Rate  
  - *Jobs Momentum* = Jobs / ΔUnemployment  
  - *Inventory Ratio* = Inventories / Retail Sales  
  - *Inflation Gap* = PPI – CPI  
  - *Macro Stress Flags* = Binary indicators on thresholds  

---

### 🧠 Step 2: Regime Labeling

- Rule-based logic using GDP, unemployment, production, capacity utilization  
- Four distinct regimes:
  - **Boom**: Growth with low risk  
  - **Stability**: Steady, predictable environment  
  - **Slowdown**: Rising stress with slowing indicators  
  - **Recession**: Clear contraction

---

### 📈 Step 3: Forecasting Macroeconomic Indicators

| Model               | Use Case Example                          |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **VAR**            | Co-dependent series (GDP + Unemployment)   |
| **Prophet**        | Seasonality and trend (Jobs, Retail Sales) |
| **XGBoostRegressor** | Nonlinear indicators (Credit, Inventories) |

- Sliding window forecast over the last 4 quarters  
- Forecast horizon: next 4 quarters  
- Output stored as `future_forecasts_df`

---

### 🧩 Step 4: Regime Classification  

- Use trained XGBoostClassifier to predict regime from forecasted features  
- Outputs:
  - Predicted Regime  
  - Class Probabilities  
  - Feature attribution via **SHAP values**  
- Stored in `regime_predictions.csv`

## 🔍 Interpretability & Evaluation

### 📊 Transparency Techniques

| Tool           | Insight                                       |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| SHAP (Global)  | Regime-specific top features                  |
| SHAP (Local)   | Drivers of a specific quarterly prediction     |
| Timeline Drift | Feature importance changes over time          |
| Transition Matrix | Model accuracy around regime shifts        |

### 📋 Model Performance

- **Confusion Matrix**: Identify misclassifications  
- **Transition-F1**: Measure regime-switch detection accuracy  
- **Lead Time Curve**: Show how early regime changes are predicted  

📈 SHAP Examples:  
- Red = features pushing towards Recession (e.g. Credit Spread ↑)  
- Blue = features pulling towards Boom (e.g. GDP ↑, M2 ↑)

## 📤 Sample Output

| Quarter   | Regime       | Top Drivers (SHAP)                   |
|-----------|--------------|---------------------------------------|
| 2025 Q2   | Stability     | GDP ↑, Credit Spread ↓               |
| 2025 Q3   | Slowdown      | Jobless Claims ↑, M2 ↓               |
| 2025 Q4   | Recession     | CPI ↑, Durable Goods ↓               |
| 2026 Q1   | Recession     | Inventories ↑, Jobs Momentum ↓      |
